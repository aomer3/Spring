Interface Injection
1. Instead of creating classes, it is better to create interfaces to create abstraction 
   and make it easier to understand what the class is meant to do
2. After creating interfaces, implementation classes then can be created to implement the 
   the interfaces 
3. There implementation classes can depend on each other and be injected as needed 

Steps for injecting interfaces
1. Create the POJIs/POJOs
2. Create the configuration
3. Create the test 


Switching interface implementations
1. By creating multiple implementations of a single interface, the application can quickly 
   and easiy switch implementations of a given interface with minimal amount of code, and 
   without changing the objects that are using that implementation (because they are all 
   referencing the interface -- which will then check the xml config file to determine which
   implementation it should use)

Ambiguity Problem Notes

1. When using constructor injection and using multiple viable constructors, Spring will 
   invoke constructors depending on the order (even if it's not the right constructor)
	a. example: when injecting two fields "10" and "20", Spring can either invoke a 
	   constructor that takes two ints, or one that takes two doubles, or even two strings
	   
2. In this case, the highest priority constructor Spring will use is String, if that is 
   available. If it is not available, then Spring will use the first viable constructor 
   that will work with the given parameters. So if the double constructor comes first, it
   will use that. And if the int constructor comes first, it will use that instead.
   
3. The ambiguity problem can be fixed by using any of the following in the constructor tag
	a. type
	b. index
	c. name

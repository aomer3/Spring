XML Standalone Collections
1. When using collections in xml config file, there are certain limitations
	a. collections (list, set, map, properties) are local within one bean, cannot be 
           used across multiple beans
 	b. collection types are set by default and cannot be changed (i.e. list will always
           be made using ArrayList, set will be made using LinkedHashSet, etc.)
2. Standalone collections solve both of these limitations 
3. To use standalone collections, you need to use util schema 
4. Once the standalone collection is made outside of the bean, then it can be used across 
   multiple beans

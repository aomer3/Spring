Spring Expression Language Notes
1. Spring Expression Language (SpEL) allows for parsing and executing expression, with 
   the help of the @Value annotation 
2. SpEL supports both primitive types and collections inside its expressions 
3. An expression is a combination of classes, variables, methods, constructors and objects,
   and symbols
4. Symbols are characters, numberics, operators, keywords, and special symbols which return 
   a value

Examples of expressions: @Value("#{66+44}") is the same as @Value("110"),
 			 @Value("#{5>6?22:33}") is same as @Value("33")
 			 

Static methods in @Value annotation
1. Static methods can be used in @Value annotation like this (using static absolute method 
   from Math class to make -99 into a positive number):  
	a. @Value("#{T(java.lang.Math).abs(-99)}")

Life cycle Methods

Spring provides 2 life cycle methods to every bean it creates:
1.public void init() 
	a. used to add initialization code 
	b. example: configuration file, database connection, web server connection
2.public void destroy() 
	a. closing resources, connections
	b. example: closing connections 
3. The init() and destory() methods can be called anything but must have the same 
   method signature (i.e. public void and with no parameters)


Life cycle methods can be configured in 3 ways:
1. XML Configuration 
2. Spring interfaces
3. Annotations

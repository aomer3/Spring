Autowiring Notes
1.The process of injecting a dependency with its dependeny object manually using the ref
  keyword is called wiring
2.The process of Spring doing injection of dependency to the dependent object automatically 
  is called autowiring 

Autowiring can be done in 2 ways
1. XML (autowiring not done by default), can be done:
	a. by type (setter injection)
		1. If Spring finds the correct bean type, it will inject it automatically 
		2. If Spring does not find any bean matching specified type, it will save the 
		   field as null
		3. If Spring finds multiple beans matching specified type, it will throw an 
		   exception 
	b. by name (setter injection)
		1. If Spring finds the correct bean name, it will inject it automatically 
		2. If Spring does not find any bean matching specified name, it will save the 
		   field as null
		3. If Spring finds multiple beans matching specified name, it will throw an 
		   exception 
	c. constructor (constructor injection)
2. Annotations
	a. done by using the @autowired keyword
	b. along with @autowired, can also optionally use @qualifier
	c. annotations can be placed on either:
		a. field
		b. constructor
		c. setter method 
	d. @Qualifier 
		a. when there are multiple beans of same type and no one bean has the same name as
		   the class variable name, it creates ambiguity and autowiring will not work
		b. use @Qualifier to specify by name which bean to autowire
